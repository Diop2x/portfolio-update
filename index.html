            My name is Youssou Diop Jr. ,I was born December 4th 1996 in Bronx New York. I played baseball much of
            my childhood in New York, in fact I took place in the Little League World Series.
            Once I finished middle school my family and I relocated to Waxhaw, North Carolina in 2010 and have lived in Charlotte,
            NC ever since</p>

            Through high school I found myself partaking in many extraciricular activities. From jail braking the newest iPhones
        to running nationals for mens track, to name a couple. Near my later years of highschool I really started taking my love for tech
        tech a bit more serious. In which I started taking a few programing courses and really started learning the ins and outs of the internet.
        As I've had many passsions though my younger years, it seems coding has captivated my heart and mind. From the problem solving to 
        critical thinking it encaplsolates many things that I yurn for. </p>

        <p>
            In my free time rug making and building car are my go to hobbies. Rug making becoming more of a buisness venture in its own regard.
            However my main focus for my career is to land a position in the tech industry, doing what I love to do. Problem solve.
